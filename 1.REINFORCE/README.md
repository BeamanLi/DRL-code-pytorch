# REINFORCE
This is a concise Pytorch implementation of REINFORCE.<br />
REINFORCE.py is a implementation of REINFORCE without the baseline.<br />
REINFORCE_baseline.py is a implementation of REINFORCE without the baseline.<br />

# How to use my code?
You can dircetly run REINFORCE.py and REINFORCE_baseline.py in your own IDE.<br />

## Test environments
You can set the 'env_index' in the codes to change the environments.<br />
Here env_index=0 represent 'CartPole-v0'; env_index=1 represent 'CartPole-v0'

## How to see the training results?
You can use the tensorboard to visualize the training curves.<br />
Our training curvers in the two environments are stored in the 'runs', and the data of rewards are stored in the 'data_train'
